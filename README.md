Quily Website Repository
Welcome to the Quily Website RAEDME, an online collection dedicated to Individual Assignment 03 for ICT 2204 Web Technologies.
Here, you will find all the materials used to create my portfolio using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

About the Portfolio
The Quily Website is an online platform designed to showcase my skills and accomplishments in design. 
For this project, I decided to focus on a theme that resonates with my interests and expertise.

The chosen theme for my portfolio is "Horizon Nest." It offers a simple and easily understandable design that caters to users of all backgrounds. 
By exploring the portfolio, users will gain insights into Cabana and its unique features. They can also find detailed descriptions and contact 
information for those interested in further information or making reservations.

To enhance the visual appeal and user experience, I have incorporated animations, transitions, and smooth scrolling throughout the portfolio.
 These elements have been carefully selected to complement the design and provide an engaging browsing experience. Rest assured, unnecessary animations
 have been avoided to maintain a clean and elegant portfolio layout.

The Quily Website has been optimized to work seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices. Whether users access it from their computers or smartphones,
 they can enjoy a consistent and intuitive browsing experience.

Please note that certain features within the portfolio may require an internet connection to fully utilize their capabilities.
 However, the overall design philosophy prioritizes simplicity and functionality to ensure a user-friendly experience.

Feel free to explore the Quily Website and discover the fascinating world of Cabana. Should you have any questions, 
or if you would like to make a reservation or obtain further information, please do not hesitate to reach out using the provided contact details.
